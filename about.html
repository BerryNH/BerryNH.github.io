	  			<h1>ABOUT Me</h1>
	  			<p class="isi">Hi, I'm Berry Nur Hamzah, im 24 years old guy with<br>
	  				a lot free time (i mean it). My background is IT,but more<br>
	  				specific i pick Network as my focus. So here i am,try to <br>
					learn something new by joining Hacktiv8, meet new people,<br>
	  				and of course get job,or make my own startup business later.<br>
					I pick programming cz i want learn something new,but still<br>
					not far enough from what i like, and i like technology. It<br>
					grow so fast, and from what i see now,we always depend on it,<br>
					from wake up in the morning until we sleep later at night.<br>
					We need technology, and technology need to develop to serve us<br>
					, so thats why i learn Programming, to become developer. This<br>
					is my chance to gain experience, set path for my future, so im<br>
					not screw up with my life, and i want to prove it. At least, <br>
					i cant judge what kind person i am, only other people can, the<br>
					only thing i can tell is im not perfect, the only different <br>
					between us and machine, we can learn from our mistake and try<br>
					to avoid it next time, but machine always repeat it until next<br>
					patch released....XD<br>
